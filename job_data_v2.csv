5260,National Consultant on UNV Programme in Armenia,,UNV Programme Background: To attain the national development goals and the Millennium Development Goals MDG targets the overall capacity particularly the human resources at national sub-national and sectoral levels remain a major challenge and requires a different sets of strategies and new thinking that enable the Government and other national stakeholders private sector civil society NGOs etc. to provide effective service to the nation.    One of the main strategies to tackle the capacity challenges is to examine and utilize the existing and/or available national human resources within the country. It has been recognized that the latent capacity existing in the country and in the Diaspora are human capacity assets that any country should increasingly rely to enhance its national capacity and knowledge building. These human capacity assets include the youth the unemployed the retirees the retrenched personnel and can be sourced from the public service private sector civil society and the Diaspora.  However promoting an enabling environment in terms of policy framework legal cultural etc. as well as establishing the necessary implementation mechanisms are pre-requisite to address and facilitate the mobilization of the latent human capacity.   One approach that could be utilized to unleash or tap the latent capacity within the country and in Diaspora would be through volunteering and civic participation. It has been long established that volunteerism reinforces capacity development through enhanced participation fostering ownership improving accountability promoting governance ensuring sustainability.  The present project consists in the appreciation of the viability of the creation of a National Volunteer Programme in Armenia which would allow all citizens to participate in the development of their country by using their knowledge and skills to respond to its needs.   On the basis of latest analysis of Armenias experience of volunteerism the consultant should support the UNV PO in identifying local possibility of civic engagement and opportunities for the involvement of government and non-governmental actors and specifically the civil society in the creation and management of the Volunteerism Programme. In this context the gender aspect should be taken into consideration.  Once instituted the National Volunteer Program could serve all stakeholders including UNCTs agencies with an invaluable source of empowered human capacity. In fact the National Volunteer Program will not only facilitate access to latent human resources unemployed retirees youth within all sectors  public private civil society Diaspora but also build the candidates soft capacities in terms of their active involvement into development issues. A database will then be established storing all second and third best nationals candidates for announced posts. With the objective to finalize the setting for a national Volunteer Programme in Armenia the UNV Programme in collaboration with the UNCT is therefore recruiting one National Consultant.,,100.0,10,,1,1,,open,remote,,,,,

6141,Local Expert on Rural Development,,UNDP plans continued support to rural development through integrated and enhanced approaches which will build on and compliment existing programmes. It is expected that participatory planning will continue to be used as a mechanism for civic activation and inclusive decision-making. Given its importance as a source of livelihood in Armenia support to primary agricultural production remains important and is likely to continue as a central element of future programmes as will small-scale community infrastructure.  However there are as noted potential sources of gross margin and farm income improvement which are largely not being exploited. These are primarily available from agricultural cooperatives food processing and cold storage: areas where in the medium and longer term there is likely to be substantial growth.  An international consultant is being recruited to prepare a project document setting out proposals for support to enhanced rural development in selected areas of Armenia to be identified by UNDP. Initial investigations suggest that in addition to primary production and community infrastructure this support is likely to address: - Growth and development of cottage industry and micro-enterprise food processing through a combination of business advisory services and business infrastructure. It is also likely to involve establishment of food microprocessing facilities as a basis for incubation. Measures to improve access to finance for small-scale food processors are also anticipated potentially through matching grants linked to bank loans; - Cold storage through very low energy small-scale cold stores based on high insulation natural ventilation and evaporative cooling. This would involve adaptation and replication of traditional cooling methods used elsewhere notably in the Central Asian countries; and - Facilitating the movement of labour out of agriculture to sectors with higher productivity through rapid retraining and requalification mainly for participants from rural areas. In meeting these objectives and compiling the draft project document the international consultant will therefore outline actions aimed at responding to these needs as well as any others considered important and provisionally agreed with UNDP Armenia during the course of project preparation. Organizational and management arrangements for delivery of the proposed actions will also be defined setting out in the process the role of national partner organizations and bodies UNDP and other UN agencies and other international development partners. Project costs and the duration of implementation will also be estimated. The task of the National Consultant will be to support the international consultant in this process. This support will be provided throughout the preparation of the project and will include actions in advance during and after the international consultants visit to Armenia which is still to be scheduled. The support will comprise but may not be restricted to: - Identifying and collating key information reports and publications related to the proposed project; - Assembling and analyzing data as specified by the international consultant; - Identifying contacting and making arrangements to meet key stakeholders; and - Drafting sections of the project document. The national consultant will not normally be required to interpret into English for the international consultant but this may nonetheless be required on occasions when no interpreter is available. Output: In accordance with the objectives and tasks defined above the output of the assignment as a whole to which the National Consultant will contribute will be a programme document for enhanced support to rural development in Armenia. This will it is expected be used as a basis for actions by UNDP and potentially other UN agencies as well as for raising funds for implementation and scaling-up. Management Arrangements: Under the overall guidance of the UN Resident Coordinator for Armenia the assignment will be conducted under the day-to-day supervision of the Head of the UNDP Socioeconomic Governance Portfolio. The national consultant will however expected to take instructions from the international consultant who is being recruited under separate terms of reference.,,100.0,10,,1,1,,open,remote,,,,,
